Able to use the latest python versions 3.9, 3.10, \u0026hellip; easy to use  con:  take up lots of memory if working simultaneously on multiple projects pip install -r requirements.txt doesn‚Äôt always work seamlessly when recreating environments on a different system.  conda: pro:  less compatibility issues with ML frameworks(tensorflow, pytorch). can use both conda install, pip install. saves time installing commonly used packages. works like a charm with jupyter notebooks. No need for fiddling around with ipykernel.  con:  cannot use with latest versions of python.
