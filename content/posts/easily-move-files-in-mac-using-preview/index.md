You can easily move downloaded files in Mac using `Preview`. When you download a `.pdf` file, the `Preview` app will popup displaying the content. When you hover your mouse to the title of the preview in the top panel, an icon will appear on the left. Then simply click and hold the icon drag it in to the desired directory(I assume that you have already opened the directory `Finder`).

Other downloaded files unsupported by `Preview` can also be moved in a similar fashion. Click the `show downloads` button which is located on the right side of your `Safari` address bar. Click and hold the downloaded content and drag it in to the desired directory.
